I have been wanting to be able to create my own Softstrip barcodes
ever since I started the BASIC challenges on
[RetroBattlestations](http://retrobattlestations.com).

Distripitor is a program that will generate barcodes in the Cauzin
Softstrip format. Cauzin Softstrip barcodes appeared in magazines in
the mid eighties as an alternative to having to type in the programs
by hand. Because the Softstrip reader was a niche product that came at
the end of the 8 bit era, it has been hard to find software to create
barcodes for it. Most magazines that printed the codes dropped them
within a few years because publishing type-in software was dying off
as computers no longer included built-in languages and software
development tools, and software for 16 bit platforms was too complex
to publish as type-in software.
